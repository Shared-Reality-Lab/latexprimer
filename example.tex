\section{Introduction}

Welcome to SRL.
We use LaTeX.
\hide{
\subsection{Problems in Everyday Communication}

\begin{itemize}
\item 

Asymmetry  Symmetry (abilities, age, gender, culture, needs, dependency, etc.)

\item 
Intrusiveness, Demanding attentions  Connectedness

\item 
Situation is multiple-layered, complicated

\item 
Stress with the overloaded cognition, and perception (vision, audio, haptic)

\item 
Importance of managing secret, etc.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
\item 

Identify key issues:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
problematic phenomena occur in focused situations, dimension of asymmetry, etc.
\end{itemize}

\item 
Develop new media technology for communication X that address a subset of key issues

\section{SRL commands in srl.tex}



\subsection{commenting}
For comments, you use a commenting command based on your name, which you have to set up in srl.tex.
Put it in the master version so that everyone gets it for free when they update their srl.tex file.
Note that before the command there is no space, since otherwise when you shut comments off to send camera ready copy, things will format funny\jef{ here is an example comment, note no space before the command in the LaTeX code!}.
Uncomment the srlhidecomments command at the top of your document to hide all the comments, e.g., before you submit the PDF!
Blinding the authors can be more tricky, and may need to be done by hand.

\subsection{hide}
If there are things you want to effectively comment out, use the hide command.
This should be the last sentence you see in this section in the PDF, but there is actually a hide line right after this.
\hide{This does not appear in the compiled PDF!}

\subsection{blinding}
Most conferences want you to anonymize your publication for review, so that nobody knows who wrote it.
If you use the blind command, your secret text will be \blind{normal like this}, but when you uncomment the srlblind command at the top of the document, they will magically become [omitted for blind review].
Thus, you can toggle it on and off for the entire document to get your pagination and such correct.

\section{Top 10 SRL tips and tricks}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Compile your document often.
NEVER check in a new version without first compiling it.
If you don't check, you'll forget a brace somewhere, and everyone else working on the document will hate you.
Same goes for missing included files, such as figures, that you did not include in your commit.

\item
Don't ever use the built in latex tables.
They are super ugly.
Use booktabs instead.\footnote{\url{http://cs.brown.edu/about/system/managed/latex/doc/booktabs.pdf}}
Note that the package is already included in srl.tex.
Wikibooks has a short tutorial that explains them fairly well.
\jer{an example would be nice; I've actually found the \LaTeX table and longtable environments perfectly adequate, so am curious to see the difference}\jef{There are examples in the footnoted URL, but you can also use booktabs with longtable...booktabs makes the tables publication-quality, and longtable makes splits across pages better. The footnoted link provides more information about using them together, and this link covers many tabular-related latex packages\footnote{\url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/12672/which-tabular-packages-do-which-tasks-and-which-packages-conflict}}.}
\dan{There is also this handy website\footnote{\url{http://www.tablesgenerator.com/}} that facilitates table making. Don't forget to change the table style! Look for the drop-down menu at the far right of the bold/italic toolbar.}
\item
Put each sentence on its own line.
If you don't, you'll be very sad when trying to do merges via source control (svn/git).
This won't bother you until everyone is editing at once, which usually happens right before deadline, and then you will curse yourself for not listening.

\item
Just before you use the ref command to do a citation, use a tilde to make a non-breaking space (replacing the normal space), so that your citation index does not bump to the next line.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Overleaf and git}

As a general guideline, never commit generated files, such as PDFs or .aux (etc.) files - there is a .gitignore file at /home/srecollab/git/gitignoreLatex.

If you want to use both Overleaf and a local git, that is possible, as is putting everything into the lab git repository on barn.
Basic steps :

\begin{enumerate}
\item Git clone the repository from barn
\item Set a second remote to overleaf
\item git push to one or both remotes as you make changes
\end{enumerate}

I suggest that we put the overleaf URL in the document as a comment so we know where to find it.

Also, note that Overleaf probably is not a good place to put confidential (e.g., participant) data, so be careful.

\section{Citations}

This is a must to cover, at least briefly, since it's often done wrong.
Make sure to add your citations in an external .bib file such as the sample.bib here.
It doesn't matter whether you use a bib generator such as Mendeley or "do it yourself". 
Here's a citation to the Sensorama, an important piece of prior literature of relevance to Shared Reality~\cite{heilig:sensorama}.

\section{Tutorial notes and stuff to add later}

Before we do a live tutorial, please use either overleaf or a local install (e.g., texmaker) to create a simple LaTeX document and compile it to PDF.
There are many online tutorials for this (suggestions?).

For the tutorial, will use a lab UIST paper as an example:

%\begin{verbatim}
git clone \url{git+ssh://$USER@barn.cim.mcgill.ca/home/srecollab/git/publications/2015-CHI-jeffbl-HapticPerception.git}
%\end{verbatim}

figures/images : placement on page, column widths, subfig, full width, labeling and referring

tweaking space (vspace)

math/equations $x= \sum_a^b y^3$ Note that you can build them online graphically, e.g. \url{http://www.sciweavers.org/free-online-latex-equation-editor}

common special characters (e.g.,  degree symbol)

final bib tweaks - e.g., condensing conference/journal names

cleaning up for submitting LaTeX source

noindent

bibtex/mendeley

what to do if can't find command? google it and install the package. on ubuntu at least, do *not* try and manually install individual packages except as a last resort - figure out which texlive package it is in, and just install the whole thing (use \url{http://packages.ubuntu.com} for example and search for the package containing the filename).

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you

% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
